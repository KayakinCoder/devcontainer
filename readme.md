A devcontainer with tools and scripts I like to use as a base for development.

Tools and repos:

````bash
# redis local dev/db
source /workspaces/devcontainer/tools/repo-redis.sh

# pulumi repo that has some common cloud resource builds
source /workspaces/devcontainer/tools/repo-pulumi.sh

# neon.tech for postgres
source /workspaces/devcontainer/tools/neontech.sh
````
